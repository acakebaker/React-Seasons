<h3>About the Project</h3>

<p>This project was to learn about <code>class</code> components since a lot of companies still use classes for their older projects.</p>
<p>This app uses <code>geolocation</code> to get the current location of the user.<p>
<p>In this project, I also learned about setting the state and using the state throughout the app. I learned a lot of useful things too on best practices.</p>
